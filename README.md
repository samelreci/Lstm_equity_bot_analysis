# Lstm_equity_bot_analysis
  The objective of this project is to create a machine learning-based price equity prediction bot and evaluate its performance by conducting a back test. The results of the back test will be visually represented on a candlestick chart and an equity line in a user-friendly GUI application.

  The realm of financial markets presents a multitude of prospects, yet the task of discerning enduring and lucrative patterns poses a formidable challenge. This project aims to employ machine learning techniques to train a bot to identify and respond to distinct market indicators and behaviors. The bot will then convert this information into executable trades, guided by a clearly defined trading strategy. Additionally, the bot will generate a printout of all the trades it has back tested, accompanied by the overall percentage return calculated throughout the back testing period in a GUI application.

  All there is needed for this project is to download all the files, run "main.py" file, and then it is very self explaining. You can pick the Equity, crypto, bond etc, accordingly with Yahoo Finance tickers, pick up a time frame for the data to be loaded, and the model will run as soon as you press start. It will give explanation such as trades that are executed based on the model, shows a line graph of the data gathered and then buy and sell signals that the model executed in a chart for better clarification.
